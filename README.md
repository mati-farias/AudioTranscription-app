This is a Next.js project designed to transcribe audio files into text, enabling easy management and review of conversations. This application is bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Remember to run npm install or yarn install to install the dependencies.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


You can also see the deployed example at [https://audio-transcriptions-app.vercel.app/](https://audio-transcriptions-app.vercel.app/)

Remember to set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_GLADIA_API_KEY` environment variable to your Gladia API key. Gladia is a free service that provides speech recognition and text transcription for audio files and it has a free tier that allows 10 hours free usage per month.


This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
